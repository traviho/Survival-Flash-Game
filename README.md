# Survival-Flash-Game

This is my unfinished Survival Game written in actionscript 3 and using the program Adobe Flash Professional CS6. About half of the images in the game I created using a mix of inkscape and adobe photoshop cs6--you can probably tell which images these are (the player). I originally had the intention of creating a story in the game with both an end and end boss. Due to my decision to no longer finish this version of the game, however, it is instead a kind of sandbox game with unbalanced aspects to it.

To play the game, download the SurvivalStage.swf file. It it made on a 800 x 650 pixel stage with no minimizing features, so attempt to play on a window of or greater than this size for a better graphical experience. The two main files are SurvivalStage.Fla and Settings.as, and some .as class files are not used in the game due to features taken out of the game.
