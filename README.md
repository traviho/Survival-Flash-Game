# Survival-Flash-Game

To play the game, either download the SurvivalStage.swf file or play from the link http://www.thothought.com/Coding.html. It is made on a 800 x 650 pixel stage with no minimizing features, so attempt to play on a window of or greater than this size for a better graphical experience. The two main files are SurvivalStage.Fla and Settings.as, and some .as class files are not used in the game due to features taken out of the game. I have decided to no longer finish the game.
