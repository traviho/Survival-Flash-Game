# Survival-Flash-Game

To play the game, either download the SurvivalStage.swf file or play from the link http://www.thothought.com/Coding.html. It is made on a 800 x 650 pixel stage with no minimizing features, so attempt to play on a window of or greater than this size for a better graphical experience. Some of the images are stolen. The game is also not complete, so there are bugs and odd metrics. Nevertheless making flash games is fun.
